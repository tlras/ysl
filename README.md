> Note: This is a prerelease version, API is subject to change without warning.

This collection of OWOT modules is intended to provide readily accessible, high quality, and well-tested
implementations of commonly needed functionality not in the default client.

To use one of these modules, include the desired modules like so near the top of your script:
```js
const canvas = use("tlras/ysl/canvas.js");
const chat = use("tlras/ysl/chat.js");
const misc = use("tlras/ysl/misc.js");
```
Documentation will be written for all YSL functions prior to stable release.
